# power-user-script
User script for your browser, to empower Open Food Facts contribution.

# Install
To run userscripts it's best to have a script manager installed. Userscript managers are available as browser extensions:

* Greasemonkey  – works with Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
* Tampermonkey  – works with Chrome, Safari, Firefox and other browsers - http://tampermonkey.net/

Choose an appropriate manager and install it according to the requirements of your browser.

Once your script manager is installed you can go to https://github.com/openfoodfacts/power-user-script/blob/master/OpenFoodFactsPower.user.js

Just click on the Raw button and your script manager will ask you if you want to install the script.
